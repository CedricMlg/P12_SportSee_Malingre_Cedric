# SportSee project

First of all I'll explain what this context file is all about. <br />
For a year and two month I've been in a formation from OpenClassrooms to become a `JS` and `React` developper. <br />
In this formation every single project is made with a story that you could encounter during your developper life. <br />
I will use the context file to explain my role in the project and what I was supposed to do. <br />
Every repo with a `PXX_ProjectName_LastName_FirstName` is a repo of a project realised during my formation with OpenClassrooms. <br />
Now that this is said let's talk about the project. <br />

## The project

You work as a developer at SportSee, a startup dedicated to sports coaching. In full growth, the company will today launch a new version of the user's profile page. This page will allow the user to track the number of sessions completed as well as the number of calories burned.

### My role

In this project I got a model, a kanban with User Stories and a repo with backend to build my project. I had to GET data using Axios to then format the values and dipslay them with some graphs, the app needed to be in React and I had to use an external lib to create the graphs.
